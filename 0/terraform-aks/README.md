## Terraform AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) Module

## Overview
This Terraform module enables the deployment of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with ease. It abstracts away the complexities of AKS configuration, allowing users to define their AKS cluster using Terraform.

## Features
Provision AKS cluster in Azure.
Define AKS cluster properties in a declarative manner.
Supports customization of node pools, network, and other AKS configurations.


## Usage
## Clone the Repository:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-aks.git
cd terraform-aks
```
## Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

## Configure Variables:
Copy the terraform.tfvars.example file to terraform.tfvars and update the variables as needed.

## Review Configuration:
Review and customize the main.tf and other configuration files based on your AKS requirements.

## Apply Terraform Configuration:

```bash
Copy code
terraform apply
```
## Destroy AKS Cluster (Optional):
When done, you can destroy the AKS cluster to avoid unnecessary costs:

```bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
```
## Variables
resource_group_name: Azure Resource Group name.
aks_cluster_name: Name of the AKS cluster.
location: Azure region where the AKS cluster will be deployed.
... (add more variables as needed)

## Outputs
kube_config: Kubeconfig file content for accessing the AKS cluster.
aks_cluster_id: ID of the AKS cluster.

## Example
hcl
Copy code
module "aks_cluster" {
  source              = "./terraform-aks"
  resource_group_name = "my-rg"
  aks_cluster_name    = "my-aks-cluster"
  location            = "East US"
  # ... other variables
}

output "kubeconfig" {
  value = module.aks_cluster.kube_config
}
